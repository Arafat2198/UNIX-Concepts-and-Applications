## README

This project attempts to compile solutions for **Flex Your Brain** exercises appearing at the end of each chapter in the book [UNIX Concepts and Applications - Fourth Edition][Book], authored by **Sumitabha Das**.

The book is a recommended reading for many Computer Science, Computer Applications and Information Technology courses across universities in India. It is also quite popular among students who are UNIX/Linux newbies.

The questions covered under **Flex Your Brain** exercises are slightly involved, and the answers for the same are not made available. This project aims to create a study aid for students.

The exercises are solved and tested on computers running:
 
-	[macOS Catalina][macOS], a POSIX compliant UNIX operating system.

-	[Ubuntu Desktop Linux][Ubuntu], 18.04.3 LTS (Bionic Beaver), a free and open-source Linux distribution based on [Debian][Debian].

Both the computers use [Bash 5.0][Bash] as the choice of shell.

While every effort has been made to ensure correctness and completeness of answers, it is generally advisable to refer to the system provided documentation for commands (using `man` pages, `info` pages or online command help documentation).

### Conventions Used

The following conventions are used:

-	Key Terms are shown in **Bold**.

-	Command-line, expression and symbol are wrapped in `backticks`.

-	File and path names are _italicised_.

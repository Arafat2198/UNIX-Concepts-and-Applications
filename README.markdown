## README

This project contains solutions for **Flex Your Brain** exercises appearing at the end of each chapter in the book [UNIX Concepts and Applications - Fourth Edition][Book] authored by **Sumitabha Das**.

The book is recommended reading for many Computer Science, Computer Applications and Information Technology courses across universities in India. It is also quite popular among students who are UNIX/Linux newbies.

The questions covered under **Flex Your Brain** exercises are slightly difficult to solve, and the answers for the same are not provided in the book. This project aims to provide a study aid by compiling solutions for the same.

The exercises are solved on a computer running the latest release of [macOS Catalina][macOS], a POSIX compliant UNIX operating system with [Bash 5.0][Bash] as the choice of shell.

Every effort has been made to ensure that the answers are correct and complete. It is advised to refer to the system provided documentation (in the form of `man` pages) as needed.

A copy of the book can be bought online from [Amazon][Amazon] or [Flipkart][Flipkart].

### Conventions Used

The following conventions are used in the solutions:

- Key Terms are shown in **Bold**.

- Command-line, expression and symbol are wrapped in `backticks`.

- File and path names are _italicised_.

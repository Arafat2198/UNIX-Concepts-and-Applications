## README

This project attempts to compile solutions for **Flex Your Brain** exercises appearing at the end of each chapter in the book [UNIX Concepts and Applications - Fourth Edition][Book], authored by **Sumitabha Das**.

The book is a recommended reading for many Computer Science, Computer Applications and Information Technology courses across universities in India. It is also quite popular among students who are UNIX/Linux newbies.

The questions covered under **Flex Your Brain** exercises are slightly involved, and the answers for the same are not made available. This project aims to create a study aid for students by compiling the answers for the same.

The exercises are solved and tested on computers running:
 
-	[macOS Catalina][macOS], a POSIX compliant UNIX operating system, for [Apple's Mac][Mac] computers.

-	[Ubuntu Desktop Linux][Ubuntu], 18.04.3 LTS (Bionic Beaver), a free and open-source Linux distribution based on [Debian][Debian].

Both computers use [Bash 5.0][Bash] as the choice of shell.

Efforts have been made to ensure correctness and completeness of answers and to indicate the difference in command-line options, and behaviour between the two platforms, present due to the implementation differences.

However, it is advisable to refer to the system provided documentation for commands (using `man` pages, `info` pages or online command help documentation as available).

### Conventions Used

The following conventions are used:

-	Key Terms are shown in **Bold**.

-	Command-line, expression and symbol are wrapped in `backticks`.

-	File and path names are _italicised_.

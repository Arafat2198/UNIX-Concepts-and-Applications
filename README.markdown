## README

This project attempts to provide solutions for **Flex Your Brain** exercises appearing at the end of each chapter in the book [UNIX Concepts and Applications - Fourth Edition][Book], authored by **Sumitabha Das**.

The book is a recommended reading for many Computer Science, Computer Applications and Information Technology courses across universities in India. It is also quite popular among students who are UNIX/Linux newbies.

The questions covered under **Flex Your Brain** exercises are slightly involved, and the answers for the same are not made available. This project aims to provide a study aid for students by compiling the solution for the same.

The exercises are solved and tested on a computer running the current public release of [macOS Catalina][macOS], a POSIX compliant UNIX operating system with [Bash 5.0][Bash] as the choice of shell.

While every effort has been made to ensure correctness and completeness of answers, it is advisable to refer to the system provided documentation for commands (in the form of `man` pages, `info` pages or command help).

### Conventions Used

The following conventions are used:

-	Key Terms are shown in **Bold**.

-	Command-line, expression and symbol are wrapped in `backticks`.

-	File and path names are _italicised_.
